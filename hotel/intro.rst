XML Travelgate Hotel API
------------------------

The XML Travelgate Hotel API allows clients to access content from XL
Travelgate's inventory of partners. Currently there are more than 70
providers sources including switching platforms and hotel chains. Use
this API to query, check for availability and book fares. It can be
accessed by any third-party system such as tour-operator systems, B2C
and B2B web applications or third-party applications. Scaleability is
not an issue. Our systems are used to heavy load and monitored 24x7.
